# wegblob
A self-contained Django blog framework

The Python blog framework on which ExtraGravity.com is built, hence the cunning letter swap to force 'EG' into the name :-)

Easy to set up. Just enable WSGI on apache, configure settings.py and add metadata to the database. Content goes in static/content.
